# rn-demos
some react native demos
I finished these demos when I am learning react native.<br>

They may have some mistakes as I am a freshman of React,JavaScript and front-end.<br>
# how to run
Some of the demos use [expo](https://expo.io/) to build.<br>
you can use `npm install` or `yarn` to install the node_modules.<br>
use `react-native run` or `npm run` to debug.<br>
